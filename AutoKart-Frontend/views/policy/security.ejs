<h1>Security Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: January 2026</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
At AutoKart, the security of our users’ information, transactions, and digital
assets is a top priority. This Security Policy outlines the measures, practices,
and guidelines adopted by AutoKart to safeguard personal data, financial
information, and platform integrity.
</p>

<p>
This policy applies to all users, visitors, customers, sellers, dealers, service
providers, and any individual accessing or interacting with the AutoKart website,
mobile application, or related platforms (collectively referred to as the
“Platform”).
</p>

<h2>Scope of Security Measures</h2>
<p>
This Security Policy covers physical, technical, administrative, and operational
security controls implemented to protect data and systems against unauthorized
access, misuse, loss, alteration, or destruction.
</p>

<h2>Information Security Framework</h2>
<p>
AutoKart follows industry-standard security practices and adopts a layered
approach to security, including preventive, detective, and corrective controls.
Our security framework is designed to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of information.
</p>

<h2>Data Encryption</h2>
<p>
Sensitive information transmitted between users and our servers is protected
using secure encryption protocols. Encryption is applied to data in transit
using HTTPS and SSL/TLS technologies wherever applicable.
</p>

<p>
Certain sensitive data may also be encrypted at rest to reduce the risk of
unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>
Access to systems, databases, and sensitive information is restricted to
authorized personnel only. Role-based access controls are implemented to ensure
that employees and service providers access only the information necessary to
perform their duties.
</p>

<p>
Access credentials are reviewed periodically and revoked immediately upon
termination of employment or engagement.
</p>

<h2>Account Security</h2>
<p>
Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account
credentials, including usernames, passwords, and one-time passwords (OTPs).
AutoKart shall not be responsible for any loss arising from unauthorized access
resulting from compromised credentials.
</p>

<p>
Users are advised to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create strong and unique passwords</li>
  <li>Not share login credentials or OTPs with anyone</li>
  <li>Log out from shared or public devices</li>
  <li>Report suspicious activity immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2>Payment Security</h2>
<p>
All payment transactions on the Platform are processed through secure and
PCI-DSS compliant third-party payment gateways. AutoKart does not store sensitive
payment information such as credit card or debit card details on its servers.
</p>

<p>
Payment data is handled in accordance with applicable regulatory and industry
standards to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
</p>

<h2>Fraud Detection and Prevention</h2>
<p>
AutoKart employs automated systems and manual reviews to detect and prevent
fraudulent transactions, account misuse, and unauthorized activities. This may
include monitoring transaction patterns, device behavior, and user activity.
</p>

<p>
In cases of suspected fraud, AutoKart reserves the right to suspend accounts,
cancel orders, or initiate additional verification processes.
</p>

<h2>System Monitoring and Logging</h2>
<p>
Our systems are continuously monitored for security events, vulnerabilities,
and performance issues. Logs are maintained to track access, changes, and system
activities for audit and investigation purposes.
</p>

<h2>Vulnerability Management</h2>
<p>
AutoKart conducts periodic security assessments, vulnerability scans, and
internal reviews to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
Appropriate corrective actions are taken in a timely manner.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Security</h2>
<p>
AutoKart may engage third-party service providers for hosting, payment
processing, logistics, analytics, and customer support. Such third parties are
required to adhere to reasonable security practices and comply with applicable
data protection laws.
</p>

<p>
AutoKart is not responsible for security practices of third-party platforms
linked from or integrated with the Platform.
</p>

<h2>Data Breach Response</h2>
<p>
In the event of a suspected or confirmed data breach, AutoKart will take
reasonable steps to investigate, mitigate impact, and comply with applicable
legal and regulatory notification requirements.
</p>

<h2>Physical Security</h2>
<p>
Physical access to servers, offices, and infrastructure is restricted and
controlled through appropriate security measures such as access badges,
monitoring systems, and authorized entry protocols.
</p>

<h2>Employee Awareness and Training</h2>
<p>
AutoKart conducts security awareness training for employees to promote safe
handling of data, recognize security threats, and comply with internal security
policies and procedures.
</p>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
Users play an important role in maintaining platform security. Users agree not
to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attempt to bypass security controls</li>
  <li>Introduce malware, viruses, or harmful code</li>
  <li>Engage in activities that compromise platform integrity</li>
  <li>Use automated tools to scrape or extract data without permission</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting Security Issues</h2>
<p>
If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability or incident, please
report it immediately to AutoKart. Responsible disclosure helps us maintain a
secure environment for all users.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention and Disposal</h2>
<p>
Data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill business, legal, or
regulatory requirements. When data is no longer required, it is securely
deleted or anonymized in accordance with our data retention policies.
</p>

<h2>Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>
AutoKart complies with applicable Indian laws relating to information security,
data protection, and cyber security, including the Information Technology Act,
2000 and related rules.
</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
While AutoKart implements reasonable security measures, no system can be
guaranteed to be completely secure. AutoKart shall not be liable for damages
arising from events beyond its reasonable control, including cyber attacks or
unauthorized access despite safeguards.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Security Policy</h2>
<p>
AutoKart reserves the right to update this Security Policy at any time to reflect
changes in practices, technology, or legal requirements. Updated versions will
be posted on the Platform with a revised “Last Updated” date.
