<h1>Return, Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: January 2026</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Return, Refund & Cancellation Policy (“Policy”) governs the process of returns, replacements, cancellations, and refunds for products purchased on the AutoKart website, mobile application, or any other digital platform operated by AutoKart (collectively referred to as the “Platform”).
</p>

<p>
By placing an order on the Platform, you agree to be bound by this Policy, the Terms of Use, and any product-specific conditions mentioned at the time of purchase.
</p>

<h2>Eligibility for Returns</h2>
<p>
A product shall be eligible for return only if it meets all of the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The return request is initiated within the applicable return window mentioned on the product page</li>
  <li>The product is unused, uninstalled, and unaltered</li>
  <li>The product is returned in its original packaging with all accessories, manuals, warranty cards, and freebies</li>
  <li>The product is not damaged due to misuse or negligence</li>
</ul>

<h2>Categories of Returns</h2>
<p>
Returns may be accepted under the following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product received is damaged or defective</li>
  <li>Product received is different from what was ordered</li>
  <li>Missing parts or accessories</li>
  <li>Product does not match the description or specifications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Returnable Products</h2>
<p>
Certain categories of products may not be eligible for return, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Products marked as “Non-Returnable” on the product page</li>
  <li>Customized, made-to-order, or special order items</li>
  <li>Products damaged due to improper use or installation</li>
  <li>Products returned without original packaging or accessories</li>
</ul>

<h2>Return Request Process</h2>
<p>
To initiate a return request, you must log into your AutoKart account, navigate to “My Orders”, select the relevant order, and choose the “Return” option. You will be required to select a reason for return and may be asked to upload images or videos of the product for verification.
</p>

<p>
AutoKart reserves the right to approve or reject a return request based on the information provided and internal verification processes.
</p>

<h2>Pickup & Inspection</h2>
<p>
Once a return request is approved, AutoKart or its logistics partners will arrange for pickup of the product. The product will be inspected at the time of pickup or at the return facility.
</p>

<p>
If the product fails the quality check, the return request may be rejected and the product may be shipped back to you.
</p>

<h2>Replacement Policy</h2>
<p>
In certain cases, AutoKart may offer a replacement instead of a refund. Replacement is subject to product availability and may be provided only once per order.
</p>

<h2>Refund Policy</h2>
<p>
Refunds shall be initiated only after successful inspection and approval of the returned product. Refunds will be processed to the original payment method used at the time of purchase.
